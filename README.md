# Plate Tectonics Activity

Machine learning applications to geological data regarding significant earthquakes since 1900

This is a relatively simple application of unsupervised K-means clustering on earthquake data of the past century from the NOAA NCEI.
The motivation for this was to visualize any kind of clusters/differences in earthquake magnitude and depth across different types of plate boundaries.
